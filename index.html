				<h1>Protect Your Data Like Your Belongings</h1>

				<p>Talking privately to a friend without someone listening in, spending cash the way 
				you want to, doing research at a library, and locking up belongings in a safe
				are common ways we exercise our rights to privacy on a daily basis.  Now we have found 
				more efficient ways of doing these things on internet enabled electronic devices, but
				unfortunately the right to privacy often decreases with more convenient ways of doing 
				common tasks.  But there is hope for those who believe that possessing information
				should be treated like physical belongings, so let this website be your beacon.</p>

					<li>Learn to encrypt email and messages</li>
					<li>Password protect you hard drive or files</li>
					<li>Spend, send, and safely store money digitally with Bitcoin</li>

				<p>What is Bitcoin? Think of your money in your own bank, you can send/receive 
				it within minutes around the world for about $0.10, and that you could keep 
				it in a password protected wallet on a flash drive.  Too good to be true?
				Nope, and here's how to get it.</p>
