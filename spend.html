				<h1>Use your money the way you were meant to</h1>

				<p>Most of us have become part of a system that instructs us to deposit our paychecks in a bank that charges us fees, gives us negligible rates of returned interest, charges ridiculous rates to borrow money, and gambles with our money.  Every once in a while there will be some public outrage over some new policy, but funny thing is we have been bred to be okay with all of these issues because that's just the way it is.  Your life and standard of living is measured in the tedious hours we invest to earn a living, so why should we immediately hand over that hard earned energy to people so careless with our money?  Why should it cost $20 to wire money, a monthly charge for not having enough the amount we are told or not spending enough?  And almost most importantly, why are we paid in a currency that is backed solely by faith in it's value?<br>
                In our world of Capitalism, we often buy and sell goods in exchange for currency that is valued primarily by the faith that it can be exchanged for goods equal in value.  One issue with this is that it is not backed by any physical good (i.e. gold) and is regulated in America by The Federal Reserve.  This group of genius economists analyze the state of our nation's economy and determine how much volume of money should exist in the market which helps to control inflation and other factors.

				it in a password protected wallet on a flash drive.  Too good to be true?
