				<h1>Browse and search the internet without sharing your personal information</h1>

				<p>As safe and anonymous as you feel on the internet, you're not.  An easy way that you can realize how visable you are on the internet is by going to websites displaying dialog like "Meet local singles in (insert your city here)!".  They are able to do this because your IP address is publicly available and pretty easy to access.  An IP address is a unique series of digits that shows your current location and can be easily seen by googling "what's my IP address".  You may not really care that this information is easily available since similar information like your physical address is already available in the phonebook, but it should be your right to mask that informationif you so choose. <br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Tor</li>
                    	<p>An easy way around this is by using a program called "Tor".  It was orginally developed by the US military to increase one's anonimity on the internet.  Just like FireFox, Internet Explorer, and Chrome, To's "Onion Browser" is just a platform for you to access webpages on the internet.  What Tor doesn't differently than conventional browsers is relay your IP address through other "layers" of servers across the world, making your location extremely difficult to impossible to locate.  As soon as you open the onion browser, you will notice that the first page you're taken to is one that displays the IP address that you appear to be.  For example, you could be accessing the web in NYC but your IP address indicates that you are located in Berlin, Germany. <br>
                		   Not only is this helpful for users who want to access the internet, but it's also helpful for people who want to share information.  In some countries the internet is not nearly as free as it is here in America, where the government may control what sort of information can be accessed.  We are lucky enought to have free speech in America but some people aren't so lucky yet still want to speek and spread information just as freely without endangering their lives.  Like .com, .org, and .gov sites, .onion is a suffix that gives access to a webpage, but .onion will not give a user accurate information as to where it is coming from.  So one could make a .onion website without allowing someone to find where the servers are located, the people that own the servers, or the users who is hosting their website on the server. <br>
                		   Of course with any playground of freedom like the open doors of Tor will breed trouble.  The so called "dark web" has given way for the anonymous to sell drugs, weapons, child porn, and other illegal goods, but like every other good idea there is going to be some downsides.  Luckily there is still a large amount of moral on this side of the internet where people do their best to make sure sites with child porn don't live long and do their best to eliminate services that cause harm to others such as hired assasinations, credit card fraud, and weapons meant for more than protection. <br>
                         </p>
                    <li>NoScript</li>
                		 <p> If you're a PC user, you likely have some sort of internet security software like Norton that helps prevent your computer from getting infected by viruses.  Malicious scripts can easily enter your computer by downloading a program with hidden software or visiting a webssite that can install a program without your knowledge.  When you're browsing the internet, a programming language embedded in many webpages known as Javascript is most often the culprit in installing this sofware.  Javascript is used on most websites and usually enhances the user experience through many features, but if you are on a website that likely has malicious software you may want to disable Javascript to prevent that from becoming an issue.  Luckily the Tor browser comes pre-installed with a program called NoScript that is pretty good at disabling almost if not all of Javascript.  It could inconvenience you on some websites or make them unusable, but it is for you to outweigh the cost of functionality versus security.
                         </p>
                    <li>Virtual Private Network</li>
                    	 <p>
                			Another internet truth many are unaware of is that your Internet Service Provider (ISP; i.e. TimeWarner, Comcast, etc) has a good idea of what you're doing.  Whenever you access a webpage, packets of information are sent to and from servers you are accessing, and your ISP can view what sort of packets you're accessing, along with the amount of information you are accessing.  This is why you may have received a letter warning you not to download ilegal music as they can see where you have been downloading from and may have noticed an unsual spike in the amount of data that you ahve downloaded.<br>
               			 	An easy way around this is to sign up for a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.  There are tons of different options available all over the internet at affordable prices (many around $3/month if you sign up for a year) and will allow you entrance to an internet "tunnel" hiding your packets from your ISP and any other prying eyes.  Your ISP will still be able to see that there is something hiding under the rug but they won't know what it is, and chances are they don't care enough to look unless you are downloading mass amounts of information that is weighing a load on the network.
